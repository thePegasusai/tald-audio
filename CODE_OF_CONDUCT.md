# TALD UNIA Audio System Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members of the TALD UNIA Audio System development community, pledge to create and maintain a professional environment focused on technical excellence in audio processing, AI enhancement, and spatial audio technologies. We commit to fostering collaboration that drives innovation while maintaining the highest standards of audio quality and system performance.

## Technical Communication Standards

### Audio Quality Discussions
- Base all audio quality debates on measurable metrics including THD+N (<0.0005%), SNR (>120dB), and latency (<10ms)
- Support technical claims with reproducible benchmarks and testing methodologies
- Maintain professional discourse focused on technical solutions rather than subjective preferences
- Document all testing conditions and hardware configurations when reporting issues

### Code Review Standards
- Provide specific, actionable feedback referencing established performance criteria
- Focus on optimization opportunities with measurable impact on audio processing
- Include benchmark results when discussing performance improvements
- Maintain technical accuracy while being respectful of varying expertise levels

### Documentation Requirements
- Ensure technical precision in all documentation while maintaining accessibility
- Include comprehensive implementation details for audio processing features
- Provide clear integration guidelines for hardware-software interfaces
- Document all assumptions and dependencies in technical specifications

## Professional Standards

### Technical Collaboration
- Respect the interdependence of hardware and software components
- Acknowledge the complexity of audio processing optimizations
- Support knowledge sharing across specialization boundaries
- Maintain focus on system-level performance goals

### Development Practices
- Follow established coding standards for audio processing implementations
- Adhere to real-time processing requirements and latency constraints
- Respect memory and CPU utilization guidelines
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly specified otherwise

### Performance Optimization
- Prioritize audio quality while considering resource constraints
- Document performance tradeoffs in implementation decisions
- Support claims with profiling data and benchmarks
- Consider cross-platform implications of optimizations

## Intellectual Property Protection

### Confidential Information
- Protect proprietary audio processing algorithms and implementations
- Maintain confidentiality of unreleased features and optimizations
- Follow established procedures for discussing patented technologies
- Respect NDAs regarding hardware specifications and integration details

### Technical Discussions
- Limit public discussions to publicly documented features
- Avoid sharing proprietary performance optimization details
- Reference only public specifications in external communications
- Maintain security of internal technical documentation

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process
Technical conduct violations should be reported to:
- Technical Lead
- Project Manager
- Security Team
- Ethics Committee

Reports must include:
- Detailed technical description of the incident
- Relevant code or discussion references
- Impact on system performance or development process
- Supporting documentation or evidence

### Response Procedure
1. Initial Response (within 24 hours)
   - Technical review of reported incident
   - Impact assessment on project and team
   - Consultation with relevant technical experts

2. Investigation
   - Review of technical documentation
   - Analysis of performance impact
   - Evaluation of code or discussion context
   - Consultation with involved parties

3. Resolution
   - Technical guidance and correction
   - Formal warning if necessary
   - Temporary restriction of project access
   - Project removal in severe cases

### Appeals Process
Appeals will be reviewed by a technical board consisting of:
- Senior Technical Lead
- System Architect
- Audio Processing Expert
- Project Manager
