# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The TALD UNIA Audio System is a revolutionary audio processing platform that combines minimalist hardware with advanced AI capabilities to deliver premium sound quality. The system leverages AI-driven audio enhancement and spatial processing to achieve Burmester-level audio quality while maintaining hardware efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Key features include:
- High-fidelity audio processing with THD+N < 0.0005%
- AI-driven audio enhancement with 20% quality improvement
- Spatial audio with head tracking
- Low latency (<10ms) processing pipeline
- Multi-platform support (macOS, iOS, Web)
- Cloud-based advanced processing
- Developer SDK for third-party integration
